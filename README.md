### Tmux Bindings

We will use leader + x to indicate that we are wanting both to be pressed at the same time, and use
leader - x to indicate that we press leader and then the following key

| Bind             | Key Map             | Description                                                        |

| leader key       | ctrl + space        | this is the first key pressed ti initiate tmux binds (like neovim) |
| new window       | leader - c          | this will spawn a shell on a new 'tab/buffer'                      |
| next window      | leader - n          | goes to the next buffer in the cycle                               |
| previous window  | leader - p          | goes to the last buffer in the cycle                               |
| horizontal split | leader - shift + \  | will create a vertical line and split into two shells              |
| vertical split   | leader - -          | will create a horizontal line and split vertically                 |
| resize pane      | leader + arrow keys | to resize in all directions                                        |
